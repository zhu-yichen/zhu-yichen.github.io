<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Researher & Team Lead in Robotics at [Midea Group](https://www.midea.com/us). Before that, I received my B.S. from University of Toronto. I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Wenqiang Zhang](https://www.fudanroilab.com/2021/07/01/WenqiangZhang.html), [Dr. Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=en), and [IEEE Fellow Prof. Jian Tang](https://ecs.syr.edu/faculty/tang/) during my internships and full-time positions. 

My goal is to build generalist robots. My research interests lie at the intersection of embodied AI, vision-language model, and model compression. I'm always up for exploring potential collaborations and/or engaging in insightful research conversations, feel free to get in touch!
