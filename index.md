<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Researher at [Midea Group](https://www.midea.com/us). Before that, I received my B.S. from University of Toronto. My goal is to build generalist robots. My research interests lie at the intersection of embodied AI, vision-language model, and model compression. I'm particular interest in vision-langauge-action models, LLM agents/video/RL for robots, dexterous robot hand, and 2D/3D reasoning models. I'm always up for exploring potential collaborations and/or engaging in insightful research conversations, feel free to get in touch!
