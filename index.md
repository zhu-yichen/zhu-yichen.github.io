<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I received my B.S. from University of Toronto. My goal is to build generalist robots. My research interests lie at the intersection of robot learning, vision-language model, and model compression. I believe in end-to-end model. I'm always up for exploring potential collaborations and/or engaging in insightful research conversations, feel free to get in touch!
